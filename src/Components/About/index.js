                    <p className='column-paragraph'>Hey, I'm Greg! Thanks for taking the time to visit my dev portfolio. I am a full stack software engineer and the man behind the code. Being trained in both frontend and backend development, I can help build applications with responsive design, databases, and custom API's from the ground up.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Born in a small town and raised in a big city, I was forced to become independent at a young age, where I learned how to thrive in a fast paced environment while maintaining my southern charm. Being raised by parents who instilled good morals and values within me, I learned about working hard to achieve my goals. Experience from a variety of career fields has taught me valuable skills leading the success in my professional career. Success comes from a strong support system and my wife has been my biggest supporter. Honestly, I can say with confidence that I would not have gotten where I am, or had the success I've had; if it weren't for her support. Every day is a blessing to have someone who constantly encourages daily and challenges me to achieve my goals. 
                    <br/><br/>
                    Since this is an "about me" section in a portfolio, I won't go through my resume however, I do have one available on the experience page. Previously, I mentioned working in a variety of career fields, each of which has been a key contributor to the skillset I've developed. Describing myself isn't my strong suite, most people don't enjoy talking about themselves but I feel the best way to describe me is a jack of all trades, master of none. Someone who's a master of their craft rarely talks about being a master because to them, they're constantly learning, and evolving. A friend once told me, "the world needs ditch diggers", and that resonated with me as I thought about it. He's right though, the world needs people who clock in to the bare minimum. Settling for the bare minimum has never worked for me and it's the biggest reason I make every effort to go above and beyond. I'm a strong communicator and I enjoy sharing my knowledge with others. I'm always looking for new ways to improve my knowledge and I'm always looking for new ways to improve my skillset. I'm always looking for new ways to improve my skillset.
